# tobac-tutorials
Tutorial notebooks for tobac 2.x (currently in active development). Please use them with the [v2.0-dev](https://github.com/climate-processes/tobac/tree/v2.0-dev/) development branch. the branch can be installed directly from Github with 
```
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/climate-processes/tobac.git@v2.0-dev
```

If you are using tobac 1.x, the notebooks here won#t work because of changes in the code structure. The equivalent notebooks can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/climate-processes/tobac/tree/master/examples) folder in the [tobac master branch](https://github.com/climate-processes/tobac/tree/master/examples).
